SQL ANALYSIS
##  Overview

This repository contains solutions for SQL tasks performed as part of a data analytics internship. The tasks are based on the **Superstore** dataset and are designed to strengthen SQL querying skills through real-world business scenarios.

##  Dataset Description

The dataset `Superstore Data.csv` simulates the operations of a retail business and includes information such as:

- **Order ID**
- **Order Date, Ship Date**
- **Customer ID, Customer Name**
- **Segment, Region, Country**
- **Product Category, Sub-Category**
- **Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit**

This is a commonly used dataset in analytics to practice data manipulation, aggregation, and filtering using SQL.

##  SQL Task Objectives

The main objectives completed in the SQL file include:

- Selecting and filtering rows
- Sorting data based on multiple conditions
- Aggregation using `GROUP BY`
- Calculating key business metrics such as:
  - Total sales by region
  - Top-performing products
  - Profitability analysis
- Using functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`
- Applying conditions with `WHERE`, `HAVING`
- Extracting time-based trends using `ORDER DATE`

## Tools Used

- SQL (SQLite syntax)
- [Online SQL compiler](https://sqliteonline.com/) or local SQLite client
- CSV file viewer (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.)
